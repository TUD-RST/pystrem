# PyStrem
A Python library for feedback control using finite step response models.

PyStrem is a library providing a framework for the handling of finite step response models used for systems analysis, feedforward and feedback control. It enables the user to import data collected from step response experiments and build objects representing the dynamic behaviour of the system by means of this data. Different step response models can be connected in series, in parallel or by feedback and the response of the models to arbitrary input signals can be calculated.

Currently, PyStrem is under heavy development.
